# Python-scripts
Python scripts for simulation, and automation of the boring tasks. This repository is intended for simple calculations and simulations in Python, using Scipy (https://www.scipy.org/), and possibly Jupyter (http://jupyter.org/).

Octave/Matlab are great tools for calculation and simulation, occasionally however I find myself in the Python mood. Additinally python is (IMHO) the better choice for any production software.
